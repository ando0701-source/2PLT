# DEPRECATED: Document-set mechanism abolished

The legacy document-set mechanism is abolished.

The boot document set is selected by trigger via BOOT LOADER JSONs:

- `docs/2PLT_00_ENTRYPOINT_PROPOSAL.json`
- `docs/2PLT_00_ENTRYPOINT_COMMIT.json`
- `docs/2PLT_00_ENTRYPOINT_REJECT.json`

This document is retained only to avoid broken historical links.
